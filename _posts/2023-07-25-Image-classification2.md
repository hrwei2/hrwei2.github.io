Cmpt 412 Assignment 2 Spring 2023: This assignment aims to get hands-on experience designing and training deep convolutional neural networks using PyTorch. Starting from the professor's baseline architecture, I had to develop and improve a deep net architecture to classify images into 100 categories. By using trial and error and analyzing the data, I narrowed down the scope of the assignment. Through an iterative process, I adapted the baseline architecture to meet my needs. The performance of my architecture is then uploaded to the Kaggel competition. At the end of the project, I scored in the top 10% in the class in accuracy.
