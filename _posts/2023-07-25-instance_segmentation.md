The assignment's objective was to gain practical experience in training deep convolutional neural networks using PyTorch, with a focus on computer vision tasks like object detection, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation. The specific task was to design a deep net framework for detecting planes in high-definition satellite images. To achieve the assignment's goals, I conducted extensive research on various architectures, analyzing their strengths and weaknesses. After thoughtful consideration, I selected a baseline configuration as the starting point for my work. The primary task was to iteratively refine and enhance this baseline architecture, honing it to excel in plane detection within high-definition satellite images. Engaging in an iterative development process, I fine-tuned the deep net framework using insights gained from external research and hands-on experimentation. Throughout the process, I continuously evaluated the framework's performance and made essential adjustments to optimize its ability to detect planes in the provided satellite images. My efforts yielded success, as I successfully developed a tailored deep convolutional neural network framework for the specialized task of plane detection in high-definition satellite images. The outstanding performance of my architecture was evident by achieving placement in the top 10% of the class concerning accuracy. This accomplishment served as a testament to the effectiveness of my design process and demonstrated my proficiency in training deep neural networks for computer vision tasks using PyTorch.
