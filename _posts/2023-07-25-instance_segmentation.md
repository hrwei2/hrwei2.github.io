The objective of this assignment was to gain practical experience in training deep convolutional neural networks using PyTorch. The assignment's focus was on three fundamental tasks of computer vision: object detection, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation. Specifically, the task involved designing a deep net framework capable of detecting planes in high-definition satellite images. To accomplish the assignment's goals, I began by researching various architectures, exploring the advantages and disadvantages of each. After careful consideration, I selected a baseline configuration as the starting point for my work. The primary task was to design and improve upon this baseline through an iterative process, honing the deep net framework to perform the specialized task of plane detection in high-definition satellite images. I engaged in an iterative development process to design and refine the deep net framework. This involved fine-tuning the architecture based on insights gained from outside research and hands-on experimentation. Throughout the process, I evaluated the performance of the framework and made necessary adjustments to optimize its ability to detect planes in the given satellite images. As a result of my efforts, I successfully developed a deep convolutional neural network framework tailored to the task of plane detection in high-definition satellite images. The performance of my architecture was outstanding, as evidenced by its placement in the top 10% of the class in terms of accuracy. This achievement showcased the effectiveness of the design process and my ability to train deep neural networks for computer vision tasks using PyTorch.
