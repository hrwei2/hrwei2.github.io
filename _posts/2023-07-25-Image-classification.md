In the context of a specific assignment, I aimed to gain practical experience in the design and training of deep convolutional neural networks using PyTorch. The task involved starting with the professor's initial architecture as a baseline and subsequently developing and enhancing a deep net architecture to effectively classify images into 100 distinct categories.My primary objective was to create a well-performing deep net architecture for image classification. To achieve this, I utilized trial and error methods and conducted thorough data analysis. This process allowed me to progressively narrow down the scope of the assignment and identify the most effective approaches. Employing an iterative approach, I continuously adapted and refined the baseline architecture to meet the specific requirements of the image classification task. Throughout the development process, I thoroughly analyzed the data and made necessary adjustments to the model to improve its performance. As a result of my efforts, I successfully designed and trained a deep convolutional neural network. The performance of my architecture was impressive enough to warrant submission to the Kaggel competition. At the conclusion of the project, my model achieved outstanding results, scoring in the top 10% of the class in terms of accuracy. This outcome demonstrated the effectiveness of the architecture I developed and the proficiency I gained in designing and training deep convolutional neural networks using PyTorch.
