In the context of a specific assignment, my goal was to gain practical experience in designing and training deep convolutional neural networks with PyTorch. The task involved starting with the professor's baseline architecture and improving it for effective image classification into 100 categories. My primary objective was to create a high-performing deep net architecture for image classification. To achieve this, I utilized trial and error methods and conducted thorough data analysis, narrowing down the scope and identifying effective approaches. Employing an iterative approach, I continuously adapted and refined the baseline architecture to meet the specific requirements of image classification. Throughout the development process, I analyzed data and made necessary adjustments to enhance the model's performance. As a result of my efforts, I successfully designed and trained a deep convolutional neural network. The impressive performance of my architecture led me to submit it to the Kaggel competition. At the project's conclusion, my model achieved outstanding results, ranking in the top 10% of the class for accuracy. This outcome showcased the effectiveness of my developed architecture and demonstrated my proficiency in designing and training deep convolutional neural networks with PyTorch.
